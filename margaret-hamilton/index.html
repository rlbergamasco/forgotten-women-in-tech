      <h1>MARGARET HAMILTON</h1>
      <p id="margaret-p">
        Computer pioneer Margaret Hamilton was critical to landing astronauts on
        the moon for the first time on 20 July 1969 and returning them safely a
        few days later. The young Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
        computer programmer and working mother led the team that created the
        onboard flight software for the Apollo missions, including Apollo 11.
        “She symbolizes that generation of unsung women who helped send
        humankind into space,” said President Barack Obama in 2016 when he
        awarded Hamilton the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’
        highest civilian award. On the 50th anniversary of the first moon
        landing, Hamilton, 82, looks back on her trailblazing work in computing.

          I got married in 1958, just after I graduated in math with a minor in
          philosophy from Earlham College [in Indiana]. We both had
          assistantships to attend graduate school – me in abstract math and my
          husband in chemistry – but in the meantime I had taught high school
          for a year, we had my daughter, and my husband decided he wanted to go
          to law school at Harvard. I found a job to support our family at the
          nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was in the
          laboratory of Prof Edward Lorenz, the father of chaos theory, working
          on a system to predict weather. He was asking for math majors. To take
          care of our daughter, we hired a babysitter. Here I learned what a
          computer was and how to write software. Computer science and software
          engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on
          the job. Lorenz’s love for software experimentation was contagious,
          and I caught the bug.

          I had moved to writing software for detecting enemy aircraft at MIT’s
          Lincoln Laboratory. I was planning to resume graduate school when my
          husband saw a newspaper advert. The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory was
          looking for people to develop software to “send man to the moon”. The
          lab had received the Nasa contract to build the onboard flight
          software for the Apollo project, having already been selected to
          design the computer hardware. I was attracted both by the sheer idea
          and the fact that it had never been done before. I was the first
          programmer to join and the first woman they hired. Male engineers were
          already working on the project, but they were hardware engineers and
          it wasn’t their thing. I had it as my background. I think [the lab]
          just figured that I could handle the unknown.

          There were two onboard computers – one on the command module,
          Columbia, and one on the lunar module, Eagle. Our task included
          developing the software to run on each and the systems software they
          shared. At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal.
          But then they began to realise how much they were relying on it. The
          group grew so there were approximately 100 software engineers on my
          team. Astronauts’ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be
          ultra-reliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover
          from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the
          hardware.

          Often in the evening or at weekends I would bring my young daughter,
          Lauren, into work with me. One day, she was with me when I was doing a
          simulation of a mission to the moon. She liked to imitate me – playing
          astronaut. She started hitting keys and all of a sudden, the
          simulation started. Then she pressed other keys and the simulation
          crashed. She had selected a program which was supposed to be run prior
          to launch – when she was already “on the way” to the moon. The
          computer had so little space, it had wiped the navigation data taking
          her to the moon. I thought: my God – this could inadvertently happen
          in a real mission. I suggested a program change to prevent a prelaunch
          program being selected during flight. But the higher-ups at MIT and
          Nasa said the astronauts were too well trained to make such a mistake.
          Midcourse on the very next mission – Apollo 8 – one of the astronauts
          on board accidentally did exactly what Lauren had done. The Lauren
          bug! It created much havoc and required the mission to be
          reconfigured. After that, they let me put the program change in, all
          right.

        As I understand things, in the early days of computer programming, women
        were actually quite well represented. It was sort of considered women’s
        work. Is that your experience?<img

          Programming was never considered to be women’s work, at least not in
          any of the many projects I have been involved with. Human computers
          [who did calculations by hand] were mostly all women and there were
          women who used calculating machines – like the Marchant machines – but
          they weren’t programmers. They didn’t write software. When I first
          came to Apollo, there were no other women writing software. Then
          within a couple of years there would be a few – and I did have some
          working for me – but not many. There were always many more men.

          When I took over, one of the bosses at the top said he had no doubt I
          could do the job but was worried the men working in the group might
          rebel. Well, they didn’t. More than anything, we were dedicated to the
          missions and worked side by side to solve the challenging problems and
          to meet the critical deadlines. I was also fortunate to have a very
          modern husband, especially for that time. There were some men who
          understood equality.

          Don’t let fear get in the way and don’t be afraid to say “I don’t
          know” or “I don’t understand” – no question is a dumb question. And
          don’t always listen to the so-called experts!
