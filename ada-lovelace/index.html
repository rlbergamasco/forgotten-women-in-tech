          The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of
          Lovelace — better known as “Ada Lovelace” — showed her gift for
          mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention
          by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced
          many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer
          programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.

          Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was the
          only legitimate child of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron.
          Lord Byron's marriage to Lovelace's mother, Lady Anne Isabella
          Milbanke Byron, was not a happy one. Lady Byron separated from her
          husband only weeks after their daughter was born. A few months later,
          Lord Byron left England, and Lovelace never saw her father again. He
          died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old. <br /><br />Lovelace had an
          unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her
          mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics and science. Such
          challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at the time, but
          her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent
          Lovelace from developing her father's moody and unpredictable
          temperament. Lovelace was also forced to lie still for extended
          periods of time because her mother believed it would help her develop
          self-control. <br /><br />From early on, Lovelace showed a talent for
          numbers and language. She received instruction from William Frend, a
          social reformer; William King, the family's doctor; and Mary
          Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and mathematician. Somerville was
          one of the first women to be admitted into the Royal Astronomical
          Society.

          Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and
          inventor. The pair became friends, and the much older Babbage served
          as a mentor to Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying
          advanced mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de
          Morgan.<br /><br />Lovelace was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known
          as the father of the computer, he invented the difference engine,
          which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Lovelace got a
          chance to look at the machine before it was finished, and was
          captivated by it. Babbage also created plans for another device known
          as the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex
          calculations. <br />
          <br />Lovelace was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's
          analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi
          Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the
          original French text into English but also added her own thoughts and
          ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than
          the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in an English
          science journal. Lovelace used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta
          Ada Lovelace, in the publication. <br /><br />In her notes, Lovelace
          described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters
          and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the
          engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping
          that computer programs use today. Lovelace also offered up other
          forward-thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Lovelace is
          often considered to be the first computer programmer.
          <br /><br />Lovelace's article attracted little attention when she was
          alive. In her later years, she tried to develop mathematical schemes
          for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and put her
          in financial peril. Lovelace died from uterine cancer in London on
          November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the graveyard
          of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham, England.

          In 1835, Lovelace married William King, who became the Earl of
          Lovelace three years later. She then took the title of Countess of
          Lovelace. They shared a love of horses and had three children
          together. From most accounts, he supported his wife's academic
          endeavors. Lovelace and her husband socialized with many of the
          interesting minds of the times, including scientist Michael Faraday
          and writer Charles Dickens. <br /><br />Lovelace's health suffered,
          however, after a bout of cholera in 1837. She had lingering problems
          with asthma and her digestive system. Doctors gave her painkillers,
          such as laudanum and opium, and her personality began to change. She
          reportedly experienced mood swings and hallucinations.

          Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not
          discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world
          by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A
          Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has
          received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S.
          Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada,"
          after Lovelace.
