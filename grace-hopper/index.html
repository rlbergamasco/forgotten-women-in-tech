          An important and influential pioneer in the history of tech, Rear
          Admiral Grace Hopper was one of the first women to receive a doctorate
          degree in mathematics. Her expertise allowed her to join the U.S.
          Naval Reserve during World War II to work on the Mark I computer.
          After the war, she remained in the U.S. Navy as a reserve officer,
          working with the more advanced Mark II and Mark III computers.
          <br /><br />
          Grace also helped create the first compiler for computer languages,
          and was the first female recipient of the National Medal of Technology
          in 1991. In 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal
          of Freedom for her many contributions to the field of computing.

          To honor Grace Hopper’s legacy and inspire future generations of women
          in tech, Dr. Anita Borg and Dr. Telle Whitney founded Grace Hopper
          Celebration (GHC) in 1994. The AnitaB.org flagship event brings the
          research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront,
          and highlights the contributions of women to the tech world.
          <br /><br />The Celebration results in collaborative proposals,
          networking, and mentoring for our attendees. GHC presenters are
          leaders in their respective fields who recognize the importance of
          diversity in tech. The Celebration also offers professional
          development through a variety of activities. Today, GHC is the world’s
          largest gathering of women technologists, where women from around the
          world learn, network, and celebrate their achievements.
          <br /><br />AnitaB.org co-presents GHC with the Association of
          Computing Machinery (ACM).
